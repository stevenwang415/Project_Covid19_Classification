This project is part of the machine learning midterm competition hosted by Kaggle.

The competition focuses on developing predictive models that address a specific problem statement using a provided dataset. 
In this repository, you will find the source code and documentation for the machine learning algorithms implemented, as well as the analysis of the dataset from the competition. 
The goal is to apply various classification techniques, evaluate their performance, and fine-tune the models to achieve the best possible results.
